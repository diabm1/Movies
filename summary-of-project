Here's a summary of the project:

    Project Structure:
        The project follows the standard Maven directory structure.
        The Java source code is located in the src/main/java directory.
        The resources, including application properties and static files, are located in the src/main/resources directory.

    Dependencies:
        The project uses Spring Boot as its base framework, providing a convenient and opinionated way to develop Spring applications.
        Key dependencies include Spring Boot Starter Thymeleaf, Spring Boot Starter Web, Spring Boot Starter Data JPA, and PostgreSQL driver.

    Database Configuration:
        The application uses PostgreSQL as the database management system.
        The database connection properties, such as the URL, username, and password, are typically configured in the application.properties file.

    Model:
        The project defines a MovieEntity class that represents a movie in the database.
        The MovieEntity class is annotated with JPA annotations (@Entity, @Table, etc.) to map it to a corresponding database table.

    Repository:
        The MovieRepository interface extends the CrudRepository interface provided by Spring Data JPA.
        It defines basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing MovieEntity objects in the database.

    Service:
        The BestMovieService class implements business logic related to movie management.
        It utilizes the MovieRepository interface for retrieving and manipulating movie data.

    Controller:
        The MovieController class acts as the entry point for handling HTTP requests related to movies.
        It defines request mapping methods that interact with the BestMovieService to perform CRUD operations and display views.

    Views:
        Thymeleaf templates are used for rendering HTML views.
        The project includes HTML templates for displaying movies and movie details.

The overall purpose of the application is to provide a web interface for managing movies. Users can view a list of movies, add new movies, edit existing movies, and delete movies. The application interacts with the database to persist and retrieve movie data.
